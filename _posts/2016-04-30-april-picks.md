# [Video] Systems that Run Forever Self-heal and Scale

Link: [http://www.infoq.com/presentations/self-heal-scalable-system][talk]

Joe Armstrong outlines the architectural principles needed for building scalable fault-tolerant systems built from small isolated parallel components which communicate though well-defined protocols.

> [07:25] in general is a bad idea to start a design for 100s of people and scale it up. it's better to start with an architecture that you know it will work for few millions of things and scale it down
