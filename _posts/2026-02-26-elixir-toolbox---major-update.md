I've been working on [Elixir Toolbox][elixir-toolbox] quite a bit lately and wanted to share what's new:

- More categories: ~150 now, including [AI/LLM][ai-llm] sections (and more)
- [JSON API][api]: the aggregated data is now exposed for anyone to query
- New [trending][trending] page, showing packages by recent downloads
- `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` endpoints so LLMs can read the catalog: try asking your AI agent to "find me the best Elixir package for X using elixir-toolbox.dev"
- Complete UI refresh, using [DaisyUI][daisyui]
- GitLab support

This is a passion project. I use it to keep my Elixir skills sharp, and hopefully it helps others too. Check it out!
