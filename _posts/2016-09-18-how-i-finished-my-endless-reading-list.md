I keep all my reading list on [Pocket][getpocket], which is a great app for that. I got the Chrome extension, mobile app and even an [integration on IFTTT][ifttt] that saves all my liked tweets to Pocket.

This is very convenient, but there is an obvious problem: I ended up with tons of things to read, which made me quite frustrated.

> "I will never finish reading all of this."

This obviously couldn't go on forever. Maybe it was [Fear of Missing Out][foma] or maybe recklessness.

I gave it some thought and came up with a solution, and then in around a month I basically got my "pocket inbox" to zero. How did I do that?

Definitely, not by reading all of them.

# Understanding why

First thing I convinced myself of is that, __if something is really important and I should know about it, then eventually I will know about it__.

If some hot startup launched yesterday, or a new framework for my favorite programming language was just released, do I really have to know about it right now? Unless that's my goal, then probably not.

Second thing was that, I wouldn't be able to read about all sorts of subjects anyway. I had to focus.

# Focus

This was the toughest step. There were so many interesting topics that would be cool to get to know more but I had to let go somehow.

To help with my focus, I adapted the [100-10-1][100] method for my use case.

I created few to-do lists divided by topic, like Books, Movies, "To Learn", Side Projects and so on.

Most of my items in Pocket fell into topics for "To Learn" bucket. I went through all of the topics there, choose 3 that I was mostly interested in, and spent around 1 week reading more about each of them.

In the end, I had made my only choice(s). I had one topic to learn, one book to read, one side project and so on.

# Delete it!

That was the easy part!

Now that I was sure of what I wanted to focus, I was free to ignore things I didn't care about so much.

I went through Pocket, ordered things by the oldest and for each article, few things could happen to it:

1. It was on the topic that I wanted to focus, so I kept it;
2. It was not my focus, but it was on my to-do list, so I saved on the to-do list;
3. I had no idea why I saved it, so I deleted it;

# Iterate

At some point, when I was reaching nearly "inbox zero", I went back to my list to re-prioritize it. At least for me, it's fascinating how the priority changes as the time passes.

For example, I could be quite excited about Machine Learning three months ago, but not so much right now, so that's going to get a lower priority.

# Conclusion

That made me reach zero items on Pocket to read 😅!

I am still interested on learning various topics, reading tons of books and building many side projects. They're still there in my list and will come back and re-prioritize them.

How about you? Do you also have a long reading list? Let me know in the comments!

Have a nice week!
