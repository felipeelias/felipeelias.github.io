> SE means Software Engineer, Developer or Programmer.

It may sound shocking for some people, but: as a Software Engineer, you are **not** hired to code 100% of the time.

Companies hire you to **solve problems**. You happen to have SE skills. The code that you write is just the medium.

Most of the times, solving a problem to a SE, you need to:
* talk to a lot of people
* read a lot of code
* draw a diagram of very complex flows
* break down a large project
* plan such a large project
* estimate with little to no context
* the list goes on

And most important of all: **thinking**.

The best SEs I know are the ones that bring the most value to the business with the code that they write.
