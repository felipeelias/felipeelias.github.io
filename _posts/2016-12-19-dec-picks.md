November was a slow month since I was on vacation, but I managed to pick up some good stuff. Take a look!

# The Myth of the Root Cause

Link: [http://blog.scalyr.com/2016/10/the-myth-of-the-root-cause/][root-cause]

I learned a lot from this post, and the paper it refers to: ["How Complex Systems Fail"][fail].

If you work with distributed systems and you ever had to write a post-mortem this is a must read. The post explains common false assumptions when looking for a root cause of an incident, in other words:

- Distributed systems work as broken by default
- There is no single root cause for an incident, but a combination of them
- Avoid the [hindsight bias][bias], which is "...the inclination, after an event has occurred, to see the event as having been predictable, despite there having been little or no objective basis for predicting it."
- Every change added to the system has a potential to create another incident, even though the ones added to fix an incident

# 12 Signs You’re Working in a Feature Factory

> I started using the term when a software developer friend complained that he was “just sitting in the factory, cranking out features, and sending them down the line.”

# Self-promotion 😎

I wrote this when debugging some weird memory leak in a Ruby app. I wanted to have a way to see memory changes on a process over time, not just the current value. So I've built this:

# The Cyber Swiss Army Knife

Link: [https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef][chef]

> A simple, intuitive web app for analysing and decoding data without having to deal with complex tools or programming languages. CyberChef encourages both technical and non-technical people to explore data formats, encryption and compression.

# Simple Units Conversions

If you ever had to convert an unit to another (e.g. seconds to hours), there is a tool available on OSX and Linux by default: It's `units`!

```
→ units
586 units, 56 prefixes
You have: 600 seconds
You want: minutes
  * 10
  / 0.1
You have: 100 kilometers/hour
You want: miles/hour
  * 62.137119
  / 0.01609344
```

Helps when you don't have internet to Google it 😬

# Work/Life Balance Will Make You a Better Software Engineer

Link: [https://codewithoutrules.com/2016/11/10/work-life-balance-software-engineer/][balance]

> To improve as a software engineer you want to learn how to do your work in less time, which is important if you want to take on bigger, harder projects.
